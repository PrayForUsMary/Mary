      How to become a Catholic? What will RCIA(Rite Of Christian Initiation Of
      Adults) be like?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Are you a non Christian or non Catholic and want to become a Roman
      Catholic? Ever wondered what the RCIA experience would be like? Well then,
      go through the videos below to get a brief understanding and wish you the
      best for your journey into the catholic faith.
    </p>
    <br />

    <div><h2 style="color: red">IMPORTANT:</h2></div>
    <p>
      Following videos are just a short understanding of what the RCIA process
      would be. The only way to become a Catholic and get baptized as a Catholic
      is to follow the RCIA process instructed by the Roman Catholic church as
      per the 2nd Vatican Council. Please get in touch with your local parish to
      inquire about the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider carrying the following documents (unless others are required or
      nothing is required at all which would be communicated to you by your
      local Catholic church):-
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Hand written letter addressed to the parish and parish priest on why you
        would like to become a Catholic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hand written letter addressed to the head of Catechists of your
        Archdiocese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Passport Size Photos (One for your parish and one for your Archdiocese).
      </li>
      <li>
        Two copies of ID Proof(One for your parish and one for your
        Archdiocese).
      </li>
      <li>
        Two copies of Address proof(One for your parish and one for your
        Archdiocese).
      </li>
      <li>
        Two copies of Birth Certificate(One for your parish and one for your
        Archdiocese).
      </li>
      <li>
        You would require a "Sponsor" and a "God Father" both have to be
        baptized catholics and from the same parish you would join. Sponsor
        would have have to be available everytime required during the process.
        The God Father will be required during your Baptism.
      </li>
      <li>
        An adult can get baptized only on easter and only after completing the
        RCIA.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to become a baptized Roman Catholic you will have to attend all
        RCIA classess "in person" without skipping none.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div>
      <p>
        If you do not have a Catholic Church in your Country and you would like
        to attend RCIA and have no means then you can attend the free recorded
        classes offered from
        <a href="https://www.catholiconline.school/"
          >https://www.catholiconline.school/</a
        >
        you can always also find classes on youtube as well. However,to become a
        catholic you would have to contact a Catholic priest.
