          Mary was present throughout Jesus' life, even at his crucifixion. By
          praying the rosary, we can contemplate how we to serve God by
          following her example.

      <h3>Five Reasons You Should Pray the Rosary</h3>
      <p>
        1. We need a break from chaos News and social media are inundated with
        stories full of violence and strife. We see some of the worst of
        humanity on display and it often fills us with feelings of hopelessness,
        anxiety, and even anger. What a better way to combat those negative
        comments than by taking a break and focusing on the meditations of the
        the mysteries?
      </p>

      <p>
        2. The Rosary can lead to conversions Through a private revelation, our
        Blessed Mother showed Blessed Alan de la Rocha that “through the Rosary,
        hardened sinners of both sexes became converted and started to lead a
        holy life, bemoaning their past sins with genuine tears of contrition.”
      </p>

      <p>
        3. The Rosary can offer protection against temptation Nobody is immune
        to feeling tempted to do or say things that may lead us in the
        confessional. Blessed Pope Pius XI said that the Rosary is “a powerful
        weapon to put the demons to flight and to keep oneself from sin. If you
        desire peace in your hearts, in your homes, and in your country,
        assemble each evening to recite the Rosary.”
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Rosaries helps children learn the faith The Rosary is so simple (yet
        so powerful) that even a child can do it. As Saint John XXIII once said
        that the prayer is “a summary of the whole Gospel.” What better way to
        help your children learn the faith than by reciting the Rosary with
        them, as a family?
      </p>

      <p>
        5. You can receive indulgences Once you get into the habit of praying
        the Rosary on a daily basis, you may want to consider joining the
        Confraternity of the Rosary. Did you know that the Confraternity has
        existed (in various forms) since the 15th century? On October 2, 1898,
        Pope Leo XIII restructured the Confraternity with his Apostolic
        Constitution, Ubi Primum. Did you also know you can also receive
        indulgences once you join? It’s all true!
